        <div class="artist-statement">
            <h2>my take on art</h2>
            <p>Art has never come naturally to me. When I try to draw a line on paper, it comes out swiggly, scraggled—every nook and bend a deviation from my original intention, made unintelligible by my poor motor skills. I tried in vain to learn art on physical surfaces a few years ago. I eventually accepted that failure, but the desire to give real shape to the mental representations in my mind never ceased.</p>
            
            <p>On my laptop, I often used the markup tool to highlight, circle, make notes. These became what I used to create moving borders on climate maps, imagining them as nations fighting to subjugate the planet under one climate. Hitting ctrl+Z could reverse all of this, leading to the fall, the reverse conquest of an empire that had previously risen to continental or global dominance. Using the tool at such a zoomed-in level made the changes pixelated, blurring into existing colors in a matrix that seemed at once glitchy and beautiful.</p>
            
            <p>On my Mac, I zoom all the way into a background image, then activate markup—this creates the pixelated style. You have to go through multiple edits of the same thing to get it right because you can't draw over previous markups. I find it fun, though, like crafting something piece by piece, working with the tiniest fragments of an image to assemble a whole.</p>
            
            <p>The pixelation comes from being so zoomed in. Every stroke feels like carving a little chunk of reality from the digital ether, like a sculptor shaping a statue from a block of pixelated stone. Every layer overlaps, each step adding unique texture, leaving trails of jagged edges and blocky patterns that reveal their true nature only when you zoom out. It's like weaving pieces of something larger, giving it structure while knowing it's made from the smallest details.</p>
            
            <p>Unlike traditional drawing where lines flow smoothly, this feels like stacking bits of chaos and order in tight, limited space—each edit building on the last, creating an abstract but beautiful mess. It reminds me of how nature itself seems pixelated up close, like zooming in on a flower petal or leaf and seeing individual cells, each part of a greater design.</p>
            
            <p>In the end, it's all about the imperfections: the way pixels get slightly misaligned, the way one mark bleeds into another, and how the whole becomes something I never could have planned perfectly. I realize my "failure" with traditional art wasn't failure at all—it's just a different process, one that works through digital exploration rather than brushstrokes.</p>

                        A portrait of a deep-sea diver fish moving through a vast, intangible liquid, constantly yearning and searching for something just beyond reach. The pixelated form dissolves at the edges, blurring the boundary between creature and void. The blue-grey tones evoke the crushing depths where light barely penetrates, while the red accent suggests a vital warmth—a heart still beating despite the pressure. This piece captures the eternal drift of searching without finding, the ache of movement without destination, suspended in an endless medium that both sustains and isolates.

                    <div class="artwork-title">persistence flower</div>
                    <div class="artwork-description">
                        A flower that sprouts from the cold, showing the persistence of life and vitality even against the coolness of society's stem. The contrasting red and blue create a visual tension between warmth and frost, passion and constraint. The organic curves of the petals stand defiant against the rigid, angular stem that seeks to contain it. Each pixelated layer adds to the sense of something fighting through barriers to bloom—imperfect, textured, real. The white void surrounding it emphasizes its solitude, yet the flower's vibrant presence suggests that isolation cannot suppress what is determined to grow.

                        A pixelated hand/arm extending toward a small creature that is, as it turns out, the origin of the large arm—scaled and rotated against a starry void. Explores themes of connection, scale, and digital isolation. The hand seems to rise from the dead, reaching toward the splotches of the background.

                        The first of the pixelated sketches. Experimentation mostly with texture—the red surface appears rough given the art style. The stripes and eyes are additional details that help identify the subject while blending with other aspects of the fish's skin. Evokes an aura of nostalgia, perhaps harking back to old Pokémon games and creepypasta mythos.

                        Sunflowers with void centers and layered stems, showing accumulated markup creating organic forms from geometric blocks. The flowers coalesce into one large, leafy organism with smaller versions growing as nodes. The impression is one of claustrophobia—an organism showing immense growth in a world where nothing else exists besides it. Scaling techniques used to fullest extent with focus on arrangement and multiplicity.
